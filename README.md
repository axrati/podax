# Podax
## A simple, lightweight app that lets you encrypt/decrypt files & directories with a custom keyphrase.


Most operating systems/applications that encrypt data store their keys on your computer. That sounds like a pretty easy place for hackers to find it.

Podax lets you create your own keys to encrypt whatever files/directories you want. Don't forget what you set it as! - Always write down the file/key combination and store it in a safe place.

## Phantom Keys
Keys are never stored and deleted from memory right after encryption.
