# Podax
### A simple, lightweight app that lets you encrypt/decrypt files or entire directories in complete privacy.
<br />

This application was built so that anybody and everybody can exercise their right to privacy in the digital age. The application uses AES 256 CTR encryption and suggests strong passwords to protect your information, but will never remember them. It's highly recommended you use as long/sophisticated password as possible. You can look at cryptocurrency wallets for a good idea of how to build a good password - the Podax password suggestions use the same vocabulary list as the Monero cryptocurrency wallets.
<br />
Most operating systems/applications that encrypt data store their keys on your computer. That's like buying a safe and hiding the key in the same room... Sounds like a pretty easy place for someone to find it.
<br />

Podax will never save passwords and was built open-source so that you can verify there are no keyloggers or network communications being made. 
#### ~ Encrypt your data with confidence and ease ~
